            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet they ſeek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteouſneſs, and forſook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of Iuſtice: they take delight in approching to God. Wherefore have we faſted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſoul, and thou takeſt no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your faſt you find pleaſure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs: ye ſhall not faſt as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen? a day for a man to afflict his ſoul? is it to bow down his head as a bulruſh, and to ſpread ſackcloth and aſhes under him? wilt thou call this a Faſt, and an acceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the Faſt that I have choſen? to looſe the bands of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out, to thy houſe? when thou ſeeſt the
<pb facs="tcp:52539:6"/> naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh? Then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning, &amp; thine health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily: and thy righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee, the glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rereward. Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer: thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, Here I am: if thou take away from the midſt of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and ſpeaking vanity: And if thou draw out thy ſoul to the hungry, and ſatisfie the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſoul: then ſhall thy light riſe in obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thy darkneſs be as the noon-day. And the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie thy ſoul in drought, and make fat thy bones, and thou ſhalt be like a watered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and like a ſpring of water, whoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fail not. And they that ſhall be of thee, ſhall build the old waſte places: thou ſhalt raiſe up the foundations of many generations; and thou ſhalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The reſtorer of paths to dwell in. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the ſabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words: Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf in the Lord, and I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Iacob thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</p>

                  <p>ANd he looked up, and ſaw the rich men caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their gifts into the treaſury. And he ſaw alſo a certain poor widow caſting in thither two mites. And he ſaid, Of a truth I ſay unto you, that this poor widow hath caſt in more then they all. For all theſe have of their abundance caſt in unto the offerings of God, but ſhe of her penury hath caſt in all the living that ſhe had. And as ſome ſpake of the temple, how it was adorned
<pb facs="tcp:52539:8"/> with goodly ſtones, &amp; gifts, he ſaid, As for theſe things which ye behold, the days will come, in the which there ſhall not be left one ſtone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, that ſhall not be thrown down. And they asked him, ſaying, Maſter, but when ſhall theſe things be? and what ſign will there be when theſe things ſhall come to paſs? And he ſaid, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. But when ye ſhall hear of Wars, and commotions, be not terrified: for theſe things muſt firſt come to paſs, but the end is not by and by. Then ſaid he unto them, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall riſe againſt nation, and kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt kingdom: And great earthquakes ſhall be in divers places, and famines, and peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and fearful ſights, and great ſigns ſhall there be from heaven. But before all theſe they ſhall ſay their hands on you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you, delivering you up to the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and into priſons, being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kings and rulers for my names ſake. And it ſhall turn to you for a teſtimony. Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before, what ye ſhall anſwer. For I will give you a mouth and wiſdom, which all your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhall not be able to gainſay, nor reſiſt. And ye ſhall be betrayed, both by parents, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and kinsfolks, and friends, and ſome of you ſhall they cauſe to be put to death. And ye ſhall be hated of all men for my names ſake. But there ſhall not an hair of your head periſh. In your patience poſſeſs ye your ſouls. And when ye ſhall ſee Ieruſalem compaſſed with armies, then know that the deſolation thereof
<pb facs="tcp:52539:8"/> is nigh. Then let them which are in Iudea, flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the midſt of it, depart out; and let not them that are in the countreys, enter thereinto. For theſe be the days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled. But we unto them that are with child, and to them that give ſuck in thoſe days: for there ſhall be great diſtreſſe in the land, and wrath upon this people. And they ſhall fall by the edge of the ſword, and ſhall be led away captive into all nations, and Ieruſalem ſhall be troden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. And there ſhall be ſigns in the ſun, and in the moon, and in the ſtars, and upon the earth diſtreſs of nations, with perplexity, the ſea and the waves roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mens hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken. And then ſhall they ſee the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. And when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh. And he ſpake to them a parable, Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; When they now ſhoot forth, ye ſee and know of your own ſelves, that ſummer is now nigh at hand. So likewiſe ye, when ye ſee theſe things come to paſs, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily, I ſay unto you, This generation ſhall not paſs away, till all be fulfilled. Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away. And take heed to your ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:52539:9"/> leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeting and drunkenneſs, and cares of this life, and ſo that day come upon you una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares. For as a ſnare ſhall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of man. And in the day-time he was teaching in the temple, and at night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.

<pb facs="tcp:52539:19"/> and was incarnate by the holy Ghoſt of the Virgin Mary, and was made man, and was crucified alſo for us under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> He ſuffered, and was buried, and the third day he roſe again, according to the Scriptures, and aſcended into heaven, and ſitteth on the right hand of the Father. And he ſhall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: whoſe kingdom ſhall have no end.</p>
                  <p>And I believe in the holy Ghoſt, the Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, who with the Father and the Son together is worſhipped and glorified, who ſpake by the Prophets. And I believe one Catholick and Apoſtolick Church. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge one Baptiſm for the remiſſion of ſins. And I look for the reſurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>

                  <p>LOrd, thou haſt been our refuge: from one generation to another.</p>
                  <p>Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever the earth and the world were made: thou art God from everlaſting, and world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>
                  <p>Thou turneſt man to deſtruction: again thou ſayeſt, Come again, ye children of men.</p>
                  <p>For a thouſand years in thy ſight are but as yeſterday: ſeeing that is paſt as a watch in the night.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as thou ſcattereſt them, they are even as a ſleep: and fade away ſuddenly like the graſs:</p>
                  <p>In the morning it is green, and groweth up: but in the evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.</p>
                  <p>For we conſume away in thy diſpleaſure: and are afraid at thy wrathful indignation.</p>
                  <p>Thou haſt ſet our miſdeeds before thee: and our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</p>
                  <p>For when thou art angry, all our days are gone: we bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.</p>
                  <p>The days of our age are three ſcore years and ten, and though men be ſo ſtrong, that they come to fourſcore years: yet is their ſtrength then but labour, and ſorrow; ſo ſoon paſſeth it away, and we are gone.</p>
                  <p>But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: for even thereafter as a man feareth, ſo is thy diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>So teach us to number our days: that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:52539:26"/> to morrow I will ſtand on the top of the hill, with the rod of God in mine hand. So Ioſhua did as Moſes had ſaid to him?, and fought with Amalek: and Moſes, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill. And it came to paſs, When Moſes held up his hand, that Iſrael prevailed: And when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moſes hands were heavy, and they took a ſtone, and put it under him, and he ſat thereon: And Aaron and Hur ſtayed up his hands, the one on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide; and his hands were ſteady until the going down of the ſun. And Ioſhua diſcomfited Amalek, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the edge of the ſword. And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearſe it in the ears of Ioſhua; for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. And Moſes built an altar, and called the name of it, IEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH-niſſi. For he ſaid, Becauſe the Lord hath ſworn, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>NOw faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we underſtand that the worlds were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen, were not made of things which do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice then Cain, by which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained witneſs that he was righteous, God teſtifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead, yet ſpeaketh. By faith Enoch was tranſlated, that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found, becauſe God had tranſlated him: for before his tranſlation, he had this teſtimony, that he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God. But without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him; for he that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them that diligently ſeek him. By
<pb facs="tcp:52539:27"/> faith Noah, being warned of God of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the ſaving of his houſe, by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteouſneſs which is by faith. By faith A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, when he was called to go out into a place which he ſhould after receive for an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he ſojourned in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange countrey, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in tabernacles with Iſaac and Iacob, the heirs with him of the ſame promiſe. For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God. Though faith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Sam her ſelf received ſtrength to conceive ſeed, and was delivered of a child, when ſhe was paſt age, becauſe ſhe judged him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful who had promiſed. Therefore ſprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, ſo many as the ſtars of the ſky in multitude, and as the ſand which is by the ſea-ſhore innumerable. Theſe all died in faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſwaded of them, and embraced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers, and pilgrims on the earth. For they that ſay ſuch things declare plainly that they ſeek a countrey. And truly, if they had been mindful of that countrey, from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: But now they deſire a better countrey, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not aſhamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city. By faith Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, when he was tried, offered up Iſaac: and he that had received the promiſes, offered up
<pb facs="tcp:52539:27"/> his onely begotten ſon, Of whom it was ſaid, that in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called: Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God was able to raiſe him up, even from the dead: from whence alſo he received him in a figure. By faith Iſaac bleſſed Iacob, and Eſau concerning things to come. By faith, Iacob, when he was a dying, bleſſed both the ſons of Ioſeph, and worſhipped leaning upon the top of his ſtaff. By faith Ioſeph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Iſrael, and gave command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning his bones. By faith Moſes, when he was born, was hid three moneths of his parents, becauſe they ſaw he was a proper child, and they not afraid of the kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. By faith Moſes, when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaohs daughter, Chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſuffer affliction with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon: Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reproch of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures in Egypt; for he had reſpect unto the recompenſe of the reward. By faith he forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as ſeeing him who is inviſible. Through faith he kept the paſſover &amp; the ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of bloud, leſt he that deſtroyed the firſt-born ſhould touch them. By faith they paſſed thorow the Red-ſea, as by dry land: which the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians aſſaying to do, were drowned. By faith the walls of Iericho fell down, after they were compaſſed about ſeven days. By faith the harlot Rahab periſhed not with them that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not, when ſhe had received the ſpies with peace. And what ſhall I more ſay? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak,
<pb facs="tcp:52539:28"/> and of Samſon, and of Iephtha, of David alſo, and Samuel, &amp; of the prophets: Who through faith ſubdued kingdoms, wrought righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, obtained promiſes, ſtopped the mouths of lions, Quenched the violence of fire, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the edge of the ſword, out of weakneſs were made ſtrong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens: Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men received their dead, raiſed to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, that they might obtain a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. And others had trial of cruel mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſcourgings; yea, moreover of bonds and impriſonment. They were ſtoned, they were ſawen aſunder, were tempted, were ſlain with the ſword: they wandered about in ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, and goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tormented: (Of whom the world was not worthy) they wandred in deſerts, and in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and in dens, and caves of the earth. And theſe all having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promiſe; God having provided ſome bettet thing for us: that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</p>

We therefore adore thy divine Majeſty, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging thy power, and imploring thy goodneſs. Be pleaſed to receive into thine Almighty and moſt gracious protection the perſons of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that fight for us, and the Ships and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies in which they ſerve: preſerve them all from the dangers of the Sea, and from the violence of the Enemy, and from every ſad accident: that they may be a ſafe-guard to our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, and his Kingdoms, and a ſecurity for ſuch as paſs on the ſeas upon their lawful occaſions. Help, Lord, and ſave them for thy mercies ſake; that they may return in ſafety, with honour and victory, and good ſucceſs, to enjoy the bleſſings of the land, and the fruit of their labours; and that all the Inhabitants of theſe Iſlands, being bleſt with plenty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, peace and quietneſs, may ſerve thee our God in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs, and with a thankful remembrance of all thy mercies may ever praiſe and glorifie thy holy Name, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it appertaineth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins. Spare us therefore, good Lord, ſpare thy people whom thou haſt redeemed; enter not into judgment with thy ſervants, who are vile earth, and miſerable ſinners; but ſo turn thine anger from us, who meekly acknowledge our vileneſs, and truly repent us of our faults; and ſo make haſte to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>O Almighty God, &amp; our moſt gracious Father, the Sovereign Commander of all the world, in whoſe hand is power, and might, which none is able to withſtand: Thou art the Lord of hoſts, the God of battels, and the ſtrength of all Nations. If thou keepeſt not the City, and the Kingdom, the Watchman waketh but in vain: Nor can victory wait upon the juſteſt Deſigns, upon the wiſeſt Counſels, upon the ſtrongeſt Armies, unleſs thou teacheſt their hands to war, and their fingers to fight. Thou art the ſteddy Hope of all the ends of the earth; and of them which remain in the broad Sea.
